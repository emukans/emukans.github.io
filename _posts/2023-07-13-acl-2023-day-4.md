# SemEval 2023
## Task 2, MultiCoNER
### Challenges:
* Noisy
* Entity ambiguity

### Dataset development
Sources:
* Wikipedia for sentences
* Wikidata for entity catalog

Processing:
* Ambiguous sentence selection
* Corrupting 30% of test sentences.

Noise type:
* Replaced and repeating characters (natural errors)
* Visually similar characters (OCR errors)

2 tracks:
* Monolingual (12 subtracks)
* Multilingial (samples from all datasets)


### Results
* ~900 submissions in total
* 42 teams participated

### Insight from participants:
* Using external knowledge helped
* Scientist and OtherPER are the most challenging

### Impact of noise
* Average drop is 10% (For Chinese 48%)
* Noise in entities are more challenging


### Summary
* Fine-grained entity types are challenging
* Entity level noise makes the task more complex
* In the future, other complex domain: E-commerce
